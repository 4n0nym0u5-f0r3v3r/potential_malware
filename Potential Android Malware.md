Malware strain: Trojan
Possibly: Banker Trojan

# ‚ö†Ô∏è üö® I got this malware sample from a WhatsApp group, i strongly recommend don't install this on a real device for any purpose üö® ‚ö†Ô∏è

So let's start how i got suspicious
1) As you can see in the below screenshot their is check mark/tick mark which is not a real way of showing a verification badge or in other words verified status
2) Some one changed the group name to "State Bank Of India" where as if this message would have sent from SBI (State Bank Of India) their would be having a new chat instead of saying like this
3) If this was a legit information from bank then they would have sent the google playstore link instead of .apk file
4) Here the threat actor is luring us with "‚Çπ 6350" and playing with mind to act fast without thinking by saying "will expire TONIGHT"
5) Wording is also weird for me "Reward point INR" is another red flag

At this point i was 99% sure this was malware but for making sure i'm not imagining stuff out of obvious reasons i started doing static analysis of this apk so i ran strings to extract any possible bread crumbs for further digging of this malware nothing special but found foreign languages which Indians don't use which feels odd since the bank name which they are using is State Bank Of India is national authorised bank so they could be having Indian languages like Hindi, Kannada, Telugu, Marathi, Tamil etc and for those who don't understand the local languages they have option to use in English (This is my speculation not confirmed info) but in this malware sample Along with English other foreign languages are found example Espa√±ol
For further digging i decompressed the apk and went inside assets folder in their i found index.html out of curiosity viewed it with Text editor and found url to the phishing link
here is the defanged url 
`hxxps[://]udemotech[.]cloud/icare4[.]elviainfotech[.]one[.]SBIRewards/CFx/`
URL itself is suspicious for me since the TLD is ".cloud" which i have never seen to be used by government websites
so to find more info on this URL i ran whois on this link and found that this domain has be registered from Hostinger and the IP it is pointing is on cloudflare server
as of i'm writing this, the link is still active. unfortunately i don't know how to report this link as malicious link
The below image is the screen shot of this malicious link

![[Webpage.png]]

as we can see it is taking critical information of user like "Username", "Password", "Mobile"
by further poking this found this

```
{
	"POST": {
		"scheme": "https",
		"host": "udemotech.cloud",
		"filename": "/icare4.elviainfotech.one.SBIRewards/CFx/post.php",
		"remote": {
			"Address": "0.0.0.0:443"
		}
	}
}
```

this is the response header

this is the screenshot of console of browser i don't actually know what really happening here but what i'm thinking here is this is checking whether the link is being accessed by tor(The Onion Router) or not and some thing with port again i admit i'm really not sure what is happening here or im going crazy or it might be normal thing to exist due to cloudflare
but i think it's some kind of RCE beacon i need to do more finding in "patchWindow.js" file

so i went to check wether this particular malware sample was submitted to Virustotal website to do that i ran the command below

```
sha256sum SBI\ REWARD.APK
```

got this response

```
c82f0ca1b84241c0ecd3b6932cb6409820e0a88e014fba0f456c75ffaaf08442  SBI REWARD.APK
```

their was no report for this file hash so i uploaded the file to virustotal

```
https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/c82f0ca1b84241c0ecd3b6932cb6409820e0a88e014fba0f456c75ffaaf08442/detection
```

in case you guys also want to check the virustotal report, it did say my assumptions were true that is the malware is trojan and banker tag, after  seeing the behaviour tab now i'm thinking it can also be a infostealer ( my speculation )

after that i went to true caller to check who owns the number from which the message has sent 
name it showed as '[REDACTED] Ahmed Praveen [REDACTED]'
for their privacy reason and ethics i'm not giving their number and it can also be possible that the message has been sent after taking over the user account

PS i'm not a professional Cybersecurity expert or any other kind of wordings
